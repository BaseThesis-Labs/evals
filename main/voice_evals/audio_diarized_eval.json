And what's your budget for night for the room? Around $150 is what we are thinking, but we can stretch it up to $200 as well. Perfect. Do you have a preference for which part of the city you'd like to stay in? So we're looking for more happening parts of the city where a lot of, you know, AI offices and tech startups are based, we'll be meeting with smallest AI towers, pipette, so somewhere around that.
