My first question is, where are you planning to travel? We're going to SF in February. Three of us are going three of us open ends and we are planning to be in San Francisco from 515 to 528. Got it. And what's your budget for night for the room? Around $150 is what we are thinking, but we can stretch it up to $200 as well. Perfect. Do you have a preference for which part of the city you'd like to stay in? So we're looking for more happening parts of the city where a lot of, you know, AI offices and tech startups are based, we'll be meeting with smallest AI towers, pipette, so somewhere around that. Understood. So you're looking to be in the south of market or Soma area. Let me make sure I have this right for San Francisco. One room, three adults from 150 to 200 dollars per night in S night in so much does that sound good yeah sounds good uh the room should be we're looking for more of an Airbnb uh not a typical hotel room got it i'll make a note of that i have everything i need for San Francisco i'll pass this to the team to find you the best options and we'll be in touch shortly cool thanks a lot you're welcome have a great day",
